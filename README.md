### BUY US A CHAI

The user can connect wallet using metamask. Type in a message for the owner who he wants to send ether. In this case instead of directly sending ether to user. The user can write a message and send ether amounting to a cost of chai. All of the bought chais can be seen on the portal with their respective messages.
